Hello! Welcome to the Impori V1 Repository! This repo features four separate data files: 3 codes, and 1 game file complation.

Starting with the game itself, if running it is what you wish to do, the complete build is featured here. ONLY download the Impori file itself, not the three other code files featured here.
The purpose of the other three code files are meant to just provide easy access to the code made to run the game for grading and organization purposes. All three files are written using C#.
